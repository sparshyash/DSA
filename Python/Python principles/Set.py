# A Set in Python is used to store a collection of items with the following properties.

#  duplicate elements. If try to insert the same item again, it overwrites previous one.
#  unordered collection. When we access all items, they are accessed without any specific order and "" we cannot access items using indexes "" as we do in lists.
# ternally use hashing that makes set efficient for search, insert and delete operations. It gives a major advantage over a list for problems with these operations.
# table, meaning we can add or remove elements after their creation, the individual elements within the set cannot be changed directly.

s = {10, 50, 20}

# typecasting list to set
s = set(["a", "b", "c"])
print(s)

# Adding element to the set
s.add("d")
