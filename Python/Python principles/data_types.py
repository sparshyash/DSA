# Data types in Python are a way to classify data items. They represent the kind of value, which determines what operations can be performed on that data. Since everything is an object in Python programming, Python data types are classes and variables are instances (objects) of these classes.

# The following are standard or built-in data types in Python:

# Numeric: int, float, complex
# Sequence Type: string, list, tuple
# Mapping Type: dict
# Boolean: bool
# Set Type: set, frozenset
# Binary Types: bytes, bytearray, memoryview

x = 50  # int
x = 60.5  # float
x = "Hello World"  # string
x = ["geeks", "for", "geeks"]  # list 
x = ("geeks", "for", "geeks")  # tuple

# Integers: value is represented by int class. It contains positive or negative whole numbers (without fractions or decimals). There is no limit to how long an integer value can be.
# Float: value is represented by float class. It is a real number with a floating-point representation. It is specified by a decimal point. Optionally, character e or E followed by a positive or negative integer may be appended to specify scientific notation.
# Complex Numbers: It is represented by a complex class. It is specified as (real part) + (imaginary part)j. For example - 2+3j
a = 5
print(type(a))

b = 5.0
print(type(b))

c = 2 + 4j
print(type(c))

s = 'Welcome to the Geeks World'
print(s)

# check data type 
print(type(s))

# access string with index
print(s[1])
print(s[2])
print(s[-1]) # -1 refers to the last character, -2 is second last, and so on

# Empty list
a = []

# list with int values
a = [1, 2, 3]
print(a)

# list with mixed values int and String
b = ["Geeks", "For", "Geeks", 4, 5]
print(b)

a = ["Geeks", "For", "Geeks"]
print("Accessing element from the list")
print(a[0])
print(a[2])

print("Accessing element using negative indexing")
print(a[-1])
print(a[-3])

# initiate empty tuple
tup1 = ()

tup2 = ('Geeks', 'For')
print("\nTuple with the use of String: ", tup2)

tup1 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# access tuple items
print(tup1[0])
print(tup1[-1])
print(tup1[-3])

if 1:
    print("1 is truthy")

if not 0:
    print("0 is falsy")

# initializing empty set
s1 = set()

s1 = set("GeeksForGeeks")
print("Set with the use of String: ", s1)

s2 = set(["Geeks", "For", "Geeks"])
print("Set with the use of List: ", s2)

set1 = set(["Geeks", "For", "Geeks"]) #Duplicates are removed automatically
print(set1) 

# loop through set
for i in set1:
   print(i, end=" ") #prints elements one by one
  
# check if item exist in set   
print("Geeks" in set1)

# initialize empty dictionary
d = {}

d = {1: 'Geeks', 2: 'For', 3: 'Geeks'}
print(d)

# creating dictionary using dict() constructor
d1 = dict({1: 'Geeks', 2: 'For', 3: 'Geeks'})
print(d1)

d = {1: 'Geeks', 'name': 'For', 3: 'Geeks'}

# Accessing an element using key
print(d['name'])

# Accessing a element using get
