# Next Permutation Algorithm is a classical algorithm that rearranges the array into its next lexicographically greater permutation. If such a permutation isn't possible, it rearranges the array into ascending order in-place.

# To find the next permutation, identify the first decreasing element from the right, swap it with the next larger element on its right, then reverse the remaining suffix.

# This algorithm finds the lexicographically next greater permutation of numbers in-place in $O(n)$ time and $O(1)$ extra space.

    n=len(arr) 
    
    i=n-2
    # find 1st dec from right
    
    while i>=0  and arr[i] >= arr[i+1]:
        i-=1
    # if entire array is desc , i will be -1
    if i>=0:
        j=n-1
        while arr[j]<=arr[i]:
            j-=1
            
            arr[i],arr[j] =arr[j],arr[i]
